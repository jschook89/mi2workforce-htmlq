# Analysis and Interpretation of Easy HtmlQ Data

## Step 1 - Export the data from your Realtime Database

Easy HtmlQ data is in JSON format. To export the data, first go to your Firebase console and click on "Realtime Database" in the Navigation panel on the left. Next, click on the three dots on the right side and then click "Export JSON".

## Step 2 - Import the data into an analysis software package

### 2a.

To view and analyze the JSON data you will need to import it into analysis software such as [KADE](https://github.com/shawnbanasick/kade) or the qmethod R package. If you use KADE, the next step is to click "Import", "JSON", and "Load JSON file" as shown in the image below.

<p>

### 2b.

The file has now loaded into KADE, but you need to select the variable that you want to use as the ID for the participants. In this example I use the random ID assigned by Firebase to the participants' data (the first option, labelled "Id" in the file). If you used Easy HtmlQ version 2.0.2 or later, and depending on your project setup, you might alternatively select "urlUserCode" (if you sent unique urls to all of your participants) or "userInputId" (if you required all participants to input a name or id) as the analysis ID.

<p>

### 2c.

After selecting the participant ID variable, you will be able to click the "Download JSON data as CSV" button and export all of the Firebase data.

## Interpretation of General Easy HtmlQ Data

In the CSV format file, the left-most column will be the participant ID information. In the image below the "Id" column shows the random number IDs generated by Firebase. The second column is the "accessCode" variable. For the Demo project, no access code is required, so there is no data in this column.

<p>

If you have included Step 4 (comments for the highest and lowest ranked cards), the next several columns contain the comments for each statement. Each statement gets one column, so if you have a large project, there will likely be many comment columns.

<p>

The next set of columns give the time spent by each participant on the individual steps of the survey.

The columns shown in the image below indicate the number of cards allocated to the Negative, Neutral, and Positive

<p>

If you have included Step 5 (post-sort questionsurvey) then the survey question data is presented next. The questions all have the prefix "form", and are numbered starting with 0. So, the data for the first question is in the column labelled "form0", for the second question in column "form1", etc...
