# Analysis and Interpretation of Easy HtmlQ Data

## Step 1 - Export the data from your Realtime Database

### Easy HtmlQ data is in JSON format. To export the data, first go to your Firebase console and click on "Realtime Database" in the Navigation panel on the left. Next, click on the three dots on the right side and then click "Export JSON".

<p>

## Step 2 - Import the data into an analysis software package

### 2a.

### To view and analyze the JSON data you will need to import it into analysis software such as [KADE](https://github.com/shawnbanasick/kade) or the qmethod R package. If you use KADE, the next step is to click "Import", "JSON", and "Load JSON file" as shown in the image below.

<p>

### 2b.

### The file has now loaded into KADE, but you need to select the variable that you want to use as the ID for the participants. In this example I use the random ID assigned by Firebase to the participants' data (the first option, labelled "Id" in the file). If you used Easy HtmlQ version 2.0.2 or later, and depending on your project setup, you might alternatively select "urlUserCode" (if you sent unique urls to all of your participants) or "userInputId" (if you required all participants to input a name or id) as the analysis ID.

<p>

### 2c.

### After selecting the participant ID variable, you will be able to click the "Download JSON data as CSV" button and export all of the Firebase data.

## Interpretation of Easy HtmlQ Common Data

<hr/>

### In the CSV format file, the left-most column will be the participant ID information. In the image below the "Id" column shows the random number IDs generated by Firebase. The second column is the "accessCode" variable. For the Demo project, no access code is required, so there is no data in this column.

<p align="center">

<p>

### If you used user-specific urls, then those identifiers will be listed in the "urlUserCode" column (Easy HtmlQ version 2.0.2 or later). If you required each participant to input their name or id number, then those will be shown in the "userInputId" column (before version 2.0.2 the column was labelled "participantId").

<p>

### Another set of columns labelled with the prefix "dur" give the time spent by each participant on the individual steps of the survey. The first column "dur0" gives the total time in seconds for the complete survey. The other columns give the time spent on each step of the survey.

<p>

### A third set of columns indicate the number of cards allocated to the Negative ("nneg"), Neutral ("nneu"), and Positive ("npos") sections in Step 1 of the project.

<p>

### The Q sort data is recorded in two forms. The first is the condensed form, with all of the sort data put into a single cell of the spreadsheet.

<p>

### The second form has the Q sort value for each statement in a separate cell of the spreadsheet.

<p>

## Interpretation of Step 4 Data

<hr/>

### If you have included Step 4 (comments for the highest and lowest ranked cards), there will be columns that contain the comments for each statement. Each statement gets one column, so depending on how your participants do the Q sorts, there could be many comment columns in your project results CSV file.

<p>

## Interpretation of Step 5 Data

<hr/>

### If you have included Step 5 (post-Q sort questionnaire) the results will be reported together in a set of columns. The questions all have the prefix "form", and are numbered using a [zero-based numbering system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering). In other words, it starts by labelling the first question with 0, so the column name is "form0", for the second question the column is "form1", and so on.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/shawnbanasick/easy-htmlq/raw/master/readme_assets/form-results.png" width="600" />
<p>

### In the demo, the first and second qeuestions (in the results file column "form0" and "form1") are text input questions, so their interpretation is straightforward.

### The third question (column "form2") is a "radio" type question while the fourth question (column "form3") is a drop-down "select" type question. These two types of question use a similar method for reporting results.

<p align="center">
<b>Radio Type Question</b> <br/>

<p>

<p align="center">
<b>Select Type Question</b> <br/>
<img src="https://github.com/shawnbanasick/easy-htmlq/raw/master/readme_assets/select_iPads.png" width="500" />
<p>

### These two type report answers using zero-based numbering system. For the demo results in the image below, the first participant checked the first answer "Freshman" (numbered "0") and selected the first answer "Global Studies" (numbered "0") for these two questions. The second participant selected "Sophomore" and "Linguistics", which are both the second choice in the questions, so in the results these are reported as number "1". The third participant selected "Junior" and "English Literature" in the survey (both 3rd listed choice in the survey questions), so their results are "2" for both.
