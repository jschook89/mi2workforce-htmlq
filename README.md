### Additional settings (vs. FlashQ)


## Creating unique participation links (UID)

If you want to send out unique links to a HtmlQ survey that will automatically fill in the UID/user code, you can create links in the following format: [https://www.yourdomain.com/htmlq/#/?userCode=USERCODE](). In the resulting CSV file, the user code will show up in the UID field. This allows you to identify participants without requiring them to log in.
