## To set-up an Easy HtmlQ project use [EQ-Configurator](https://github.com/shawnbanasick/eq_configurator)


## Project Access 
Starting with version 2.0.0 there are now four project access options. 
* Open and anonymous - anyone with the url for the project can access it, no participant id information
* Open with participant ids - If you send out unique links Easy HtmlQ will automatically fill in the participant id (uid). Use this format: www&#46;yourdomain&#46;com/htmlq/#/?userCode=USERCODE &nbsp;&nbsp;In the results file, the user code will show up in the UID field. 
* Restricted and anonymous - only those with the project access code can do the Q sort. The access code is the same for all participants
* Restricted and participant name input required - participants requred to enter the access code and a name before they can start the Q sort.
